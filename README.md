# Machine Learning Clustering Models
In this project I am going to Demonstrate and understand the  bank customers data  and identify the Clustering patterns  out of the data and will perform the clustering techniques  such as K-means and hierarchical clustering  also learn the measures to understand best  cluster .
As I am mostly focusing on coding and the data science technique to understand data and get most of it using Clustering models as per my knowledge and understanding in this notebook. I have skip the theory part for the Clustering and it functioning which you will get plenty of theoretical material on internet.
Following are the few articles which will help you to get basic understanding and theoretical concept about Clustering and different technique.

## Summary:
AllLife Bank wants to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers.
Also bank wants to improve the services provided as per imput from the market research team.
Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customer queries are resolved faster.

# Objective :
To identify different segments in the existing customer based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank,

Using clustering algorithms provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.

Cluster profiling and pattern recognition for the simliar customers.

# Data Dictionary :
Sl_No: Primary key of the records
Customer Key: Customer identification number
Average Credit Limit: Average credit limit of each customer for all credit cards
Total credit cards: Total number of credit cards possessed by the customer
Total visits bank: Total number of visits that customer made (yearly) personally to the bank
Total visits online: Total number of visits or online logins made by the customer (yearly)
Total calls made: Total number of calls made by the customer to the bank or its customer service department (yearly)


## What Steps we are performing  to achive  above objective:

1) Importing base packages.

2) Data cleaning and summarization.

3) Missing value treatment.

4) Feature engineering and text Columns formatting.

6) Testing Clustering models and choosing best one.

7) Hierarchical Clustering

8) Undestaning the best Hypert pamaters .

9) Cluster Profiling Using  clustering 

10) Printing the important features for the clusters as per best model.

11) Conclusion.
